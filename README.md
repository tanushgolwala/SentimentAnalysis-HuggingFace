# Sentiment Analysis Model on IMDb Dataset

## Overview
This repository contains a sentiment analysis model trained on the IMDb dataset using the Hugging Face library. The model is capable of predicting the sentiment (positive or negative) of movie reviews.

## Dataset
The IMDb dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset for sentiment analysis tasks. It consists of movie reviews labeled as positive or negative sentiment. The dataset is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets.

## Model Architecture
The sentiment analysis model is based on a pre-trained transformer architecture, specifically leveraging the Hugging Face library's implementation. Transformers are state-of-the-art models for natural language processing tasks and have shown remarkable performance in various tasks including sentiment analysis.

## Training
The model is trained using the IMDb dataset. During training, the model learns to map the textual input of movie reviews to their corresponding sentiment labels. The training process involves fine-tuning the pre-trained transformer on the IMDb dataset.

## Evaluation
The performance of the model is evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on a separate test set. These metrics provide insights into how well the model generalizes to unseen data and its ability to correctly classify positive and negative sentiment.

## Usage
To use the sentiment analysis model, you can interact with it through the Hugging Face library's `transformers` package. Simply load the model from its saved checkpoint and use it to predict the sentiment of movie reviews. Example usage code will be provided in the repository.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.12
- Hugging Face Transformers library
